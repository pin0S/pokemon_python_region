## Pythons extraordinary features explained through the world of Pokemon

The purpose of this project is to help me learn about some more advanced topics in Python, particularly Object Oriented Progream an area I have struggled to understand since I started learning Python. 

While I have just finished 100 days of machine learning coding, I plan to commit 30 minutes a day to this project to help supplement my Machine Learning passion. 

I will be using Mark Lutz - Learning Python book to explain the concepts to me. I will then convert them into material that I and hopefully others can understand through recreating a world of Pokemon. Something I loved as a kid and am quite nostalgic about. 

I'm going to try and make this as creative and exciting as possible so keep your eyes peeled for the prologue on the python regions story. Without further ado if you're like me and love Python but want to improve your knowledge and skills, let's go.
